# Manual Windows Loader

This is a library used for loading windows DLLs. It is very incomplete. This loader does not do TLS, recursive imports, etc so it will only load the most minimal DLLs.

I am not currently working on this.

`abc.zig`, `def.zig`, and `ghi.zig` are supplied as examples of simple dynamic libraries. Example code can be found inside `main.zig`.
